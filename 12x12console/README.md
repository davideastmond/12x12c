# 12 x 12 Console

## Project Description

This is the console version of the game. 
The main objective of this game was to develop an AI (non-ML)
opponent for a human player to play against. 

This game allows for AI vs AI as well!

## How to play

This is a two-player game loosely based on GO. One player is red, the other player is blue.
You have a game board 10 by 10 (yes, the game is called 12x12, but I changed the size)

Each player takes turn placing their chip or piece on the board, the objective of which
is to surround (capture) your opponent with your pieces on all sides (diagonals excepted).

Pieces at the corners take 2 enemy pieces to capture. Pieces on the outer rows of the board take 3. Everything else
takes four pieces to capture.

Use the keyboard to input the [y, x] coordinate of where you want to place your piece.
